# Python Voice Assistant

IT'S NOT WORKING NOW AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS

So now it can search on Wikipedia, Google and open some apps. Cool.

How the command should look like:

If you want to perform Wikipedia search say: "Wikipedia *something* ".

If you want to perform Google search say: "Google *something* ".

If you want to open an app: "Open *something* ".
